        <ul>
            <h4>1.1 - Cheat clients and other modifications</h4>
            <ul>
              <p>Cheat clients, macro keys and modifications which provide an unfair superiority over other players are forbidden. Players who break this rule will face the punishment of a permanent ban.</p>
              <p><em>This rule does not apply to:</em></p>
              <ul>
              <p>- Performance improvement mods such as Optifine
        </p>
              <p>- HUD and effect status mods</p>
              <p>- Minimap that does not feature more information than Dynmap (radar and cave mode must be disabled)</p>
              <p>- Aesthetic mods</p>
              <p>- Schematica isn't allowed. Litematica, on the other hand, IS allowed.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <h4>1.2 - Benefitting or assisting in rule breaking</h4>
            <ul>
            Players may not knowingly benefit, assist or encourage anyone into breaking the rules. Depending on the severity, they may be treated as if they did those acts themselves.
            </ul>
            <h4>1.3 - Exploits</h4>
            <ul>
            Players taking advantage of unintended features such as bugs or technical oversights without notifying a member of the staff may get punished.
            </ul>
            <h4>1.4 - Alternative accounts</h4>
            <ul>
            Alternative accounts are forbidden from the server, you may only use one account per player. &quot;Alts&quot; will be banned and a warning will get attached to the main account. If a player wishes to change their main account, they may create a ticket on the Mercator Discord server.
            </ul>
            <h4>1.5 - Disrupting Mercatir services</h4>
            <ul>
            Intentionally harming the server will result in a permanent ban. This includes (but is not limited to):
                <ul>
                  <p>- Intentionally causing lag</p>
                  <p>- DoS or DDoS attacks</p>
                  <p>- Chargebacks on payments</p>

            </ul>
            <h4>1.6 - Mob farms</h4>
            <ul>
            Mob farms are allowed as long as they do not cause a considerable amount of lag. We recommend to use farms in a moderate amount and Rule 2.7 (AFK Time) must be respected. However, gold farms are disallowed due to their possibility of breaking the economy. Anyone caught using a gold farm will be punished.
            </ul>

      <h3>2. Behavior and chat</h3>
        <ul>
            <h4>2.1 - Teleport Traps</h4>
            <ul>
              <p>If a town has PvP enabled and it is difficult to exit spawn, and or you can die in the spawn chunks, it is considered spawn trapping which is not allowed. Towns can still have enclosed room spawns, but they must not use them to kill or hurt a player. Camping spawn to kill players will result in staff intervention.</p>
              
              <p>You are not allowed to /tpa to a player or to make a player teleport to you for the sole reason of killing/trapping them. If you have difficulty in exiting, or you have a risk of death in the location in which you were teleported, then it is considered a violation of this rule and the perpetrator will face a punishment.</p>
              
              <p>Nether portal trapping is not allowed, due to the lack of ability to escape.</p>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>2.2 - Combat/PvP Logging</h4>
            <ul>
            PvP logging is not allowed. If a person is in combat, they cannot leave the combat zone unless they surrender. Doing so will result in a warning, and they may be /kill'ed when they log on again.
            </ul>
            
            <h4>2.3 - Stealing and raiding</h4>
            <ul>
            Raiding and stealing from other players is allowed as it is their personal responsibility to protect their assets and maintain correct plot permissions.
            </ul>
            <h4>2.4 - Spam</h4>
            <ul>
            Repeatedly sending messages or unnecessary blocks of texts is forbidden. Players who spam in chat will be punished based on severity.
            </ul>
            <h4>2.5 - Unwanted behavior</h4>
            <ul>
              <p>Offensive, toxic, or overly explicit behavior is forbidden. Unwanted behavior includes but is not limited to:</p>

                <p>- Repetitive use of derogatory language</p>
                <p>- Encouraging self-harm or violence</p>
                <p>- Hate speech against racial and social minorities</p>
                <p>- Explicit content</p>
              </ul>
              <p>Toxicity is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Repeated behavior will lead to varying consequences such as: warnings, mutes or even a permanent ban. Consequences are usually not immediate and will be given after the staff have reviewed the situation and have determined a verdict.
</p>
            </ul>
            <h4>2.6 - Impersonation</h4>
            <ul>
              <p>Impersonating players by taking advantage of usernames, nicknames, or town/nation 
                names is not allowed. Offenders will be asked to change the names to an acceptable form. If the behavior is repeated, they may face consequences such as mutes, warnings, or a ban.
        </p>
              <p>Players may not impersonate staff in any way. </p>
            </ul>
            <h4>2.7 - AFK Time</h4>
          <ul>
            Players cannot stay AFK (meaning not actively playing the game) for more than 20 minutes. If a player is caught using a method circumventing the auto-kicking, the staff have the right to take action. 
          </ul>
          <h4>2.8 - Sharing personal information</h4>
            <ul>
              <p>Nonconsensually sharing another plaser's information or identity is strictly forbidden. Players sharing this kind of information will be punished.</p>
              <p>Examples of personal information include but are not limited to:</p>
              <ul>

              </ul>
            </ul>
            <h4>2.9 - Sharing Links</h4>
            <ul>
              <p>Sending malicious or inappropriate links on the Minecraft server or the Discord is forbidden. Players who post this type of content will be punished severely, usually with a permanent ban.
</p>
              <p>Illegal links include but are not limited to:</p>
              <ul>
                <p>- Viruses</p>

                <p>- Links which break any of the rules</p>
                <p>- Explicit content</p>
                <p>- Violent or disturbing content</p>

            <h4>2.10 - Advertising</h4>

              Advertising is not allowed unless it's related to the server.
            </ul>
            <h4>2.11 - Exploiting rules or loopholes</h4>
            <ul>
              <p>Exploiting our rule system is forbidden, just because you don’t see an exact example in our rules doesn’t mean it’s allowed. Players who are circumventing the rule system because they didn’t see an exact example will be punished.</p>
              <p>If you have any questions about our rules, please create a ticket on our discord server <a href="https://discord.gg/tGW5bUmMCe">here</a>.</p>

        <h3>3. Griefing</h3>
        <ul>
          <h4>3.1 - Destroying land around claims</h4>
            <ul>
              <p>Players may not damage land in or around claims. If this rule is not respected a warning will be given and a rollback of the affected region will take place (if demanded). This rule still applies even if the permissions aren’t set correctly in a certain plot.</p>
              <p>Cobble monsters and lava/water curtains will result in a warning and possibly a rollback (if demanded) unless it is in your own claims.</p>
            </ul>
            <h4>3.2 - Destroying land in wilderness</h4>
            <ul>
            <p>Players are allowed to grief areas in the wilderness (unclaimed land) as long as it is not in close proximity to claimed lands. However, any player may request major terrain grief to be rolled back even in the wilderness.</p>
            
            <p>Railways and ice roads are protected including all blocks containing the road. You may not destroy them or else you may face consequences.</p>
            </ul>
            <h4>3.3 - Town Claims</h4>
            <ul>
              <p>Towns are not allowed to have any hollow claims at their border. This is considered hollow claiming and it is forbidden. Hollow claimed areas will be manually removed.</p>
              <p>Surrounding another town by more than ¾ of its superficy is not allowed and will result in staff intervention, which will result in the chunks being unclaimed.</p>
              <p>Towns with the only purpose of claim-blocking another town will be removed. Creating claim arms which are 1 chunk wide extending from the town's main claims is not allowed. Claim arms are used to block the expansion of other towns or just artificially expand the area a town controls without having the need to claim it at all.</p>
            </ul>
            <h4>3.4 - Major Terraforming</h4>
            <ul>
              <p>Major terraforming of the natural geographical terrain in the wilderness is not allowed. If you alter the view of the Dynmap, your changes will be reverted. However, terraformation of your claim is allowed, albeit, with some restrictions</p>
              <p>Examples of major terraforming which are permitted:    </p>
              
              <ul>
                <p>- Floating islands, as long as they are built on top of the ground, and not water</p>
                <p>- Moderately Altering the natural landscape in order to build more easily</p>
                <p>- If a nation wishes to expand its landmass in the sea (similar to the Netherlands in real life), they can, as long as they already have a landmass to expand from.</p>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <h4>3.5 - Map Art</h4>
            <ul>
              <p>Creating map art is allowed as long as it does not intervene with other towns. If a nearby town complains, it may be considered proximity grief.</p>
              <p>Your map art may not contain sexual content, offensive/hateful content or anything that breaks rule 2. Distribution of illegal map art is also not allowed. If you have any questions about what is acceptable or not, please create a ticket on the discord server.</p>
            </ul>
            <h4>3.6 - Mob Spawning</h4>
            <ul>
            <p>The Wither, mob spawners, raids and any other destructive/harmful mobs are not allowed near town/nation claims due to their unfair advantage in war, possibility of causing server lag, and mass griefing. Players who got affected may ask for a refund of their resources or a rollback of the region. The perpetrator will face consequences.</p>
            </ul>

        <h4 style="text-align: center; font-size: 24px;">How and where do I appeal for my punishment?</h4>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 24px;">Visit our discord and create a ticket in <u>#create-a-ticket</u> to appeal for any punishments provided by staff. Please be respectful and formal when making a ticket, or else your ticket may be closed.</p>
        
        <h4 style="text-align: center; font-size: 24px;">Can I contest a punishment and can I participate in the decision making?</h4>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 24px;">Players may create a ticket if they believe the punishment they were given was unfair, but they must provide evidence for their claims and remain respectful. When a decision on a case is settled and the moderators have made a verdict, you cannot appeal to the moderators again. If you think the judgement of the moderators was unfair, ask to talk to an Administrator in the tickets.</p>
        
        <h4 style="text-align: center; font-size: 24px;">How are punishments decided?</h4>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 24px;">Punishments are decided on a case-by-case basis while reviewing chat history, visual evidence, and detection of deception. Punishments may vary based on severity. A player may receive a ban, a mute, or a warning depending on the case. Also note that first-time offenders will receive weaker punishments than repeat-offenders.</p>
        
        <h4 style="text-align: center; font-size: 24px;">How do I report a player that is breaking the rules?</h4>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 24px;">Visit our discord and create a ticket in <u>#create-a-ticket</u> to report a player. Provide as much evidence as you have of the player and which rules are being broken. Direct messages will be ignored since they are not accessible by the entire staff team.</p>
        
      <h4 style="text-align: center; font-size: 24px;">Who do the rules above apply to?</h4>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 24px;">The rules apply to everyone playing the Mercator minecraft server regardless of their rank. There are different rules for the discord server.</p>
        
        <h4 style="text-align: center; font-size: 24px;">Who are the server staff?</h4>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 24px;">Anyone who holds the role of Moderator, Admin, or Owner is considered staff.</p>
